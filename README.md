# AI-Based Women Safety Risk Prediction System

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict women safety risk levels based on historical crime data. The model classifies regions into Low, Medium, and High risk categories to support preventive safety awareness.

## Dataset
Crimes Against Women in India – Kaggle Dataset

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Creation of Total_Crime feature
- Risk level classification
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy and successfully identified high-risk areas for women safety.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outputs
Screenshots of:
- Model accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Risk level prediction

are uploaded in this repository.
